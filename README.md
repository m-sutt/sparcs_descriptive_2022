# sparcs_descriptive_2022
HHA507

This project explores a subset of the SPARCS (Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System) 2022 de-identified data. Using Python and pandas, the dataset is analyzed to explore healthcare trends, patient demographics, and hospital performance metrics.


# Summary of Findings
1. Length of Stay (LOS)
   - Average LOS is approx 5.97 days, with an SD = 8.32 days
   - Minimum stay is 1 day, while max reaches 99 days, indicating a wide rage. However, true maximum number is not found in this file.
   - 25% of patients stay 2 days or fewer
   - 50% stay 3 days (median)
   - 75% stay 7 days or fewer
   - Presence of the 99 days suggests potential outliers or a small number of patients with exceptionally long stay
2. Costs and Charges
4. Age Group Distribution
   - Skews towards older patients in the 50-69 and 70 or older range
6. Type of admission
  - Majority of the cases were through emergency admissions, which is to be expected
